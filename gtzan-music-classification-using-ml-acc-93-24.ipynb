Each feature provides insights into different aspects of the audio signals. Below, we briefly describe each feature and will later illustrate them using a specific music track from the dataset.\n\n1. **Chroma STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)**: Measures the intensity of different pitches in a music track, providing a representation of the audio in terms of its harmonic content across 12 different pitch classes.\n\n2. **RMS (Root Mean Square) Mean**: Indicates the average power or loudness of the audio signal.\n\n3. **Spectral Centroid Mean**: Represents the \"center of mass\" of the spectrum, giving a sense of the brightness of a sound.\n\n4. **Spectral Bandwidth Mean**: Measures the width of the band of light at half the peak maximum and effectively indicates the range of frequencies present in the sound.\n\n5. **Rolloff Mean**: The frequency below which a specified percentage (typically 85% to 95%) of the total spectral energy lies, highlighting the shape of the audio spectrum.\n\n6. **Zero Crossing Rate Mean**: The rate at which the signal changes signs, which can indicate the noisiness or the complexity of a sound.\n\n7. **Harmony Mean**: Extracts the harmonic components of the audio, which are important for the perception of musical notes.\n\n8. **Perceptual Sharpness Mean**: Measures the sharpness or brightness of the audio, which affects how listeners perceive the \"edge\" or clarity of a sound.\n\n9. **Tempo**: The speed at which a piece of music is played, calculated in beats per minute (BPM).\n\n10. **MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) Mean**: Describes the overall shape of the spectral envelope and is widely used in audio signal processing and speech recognition for timbre and speech clarity characterization.\n\nIn the following sections, I will visualize each of these features using the pop music track previously mentioned to better understand how they represent different aspects of the music.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"height: 8px; background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, red); border-radius: 4px;\"></div>\n\n## Chroma STFT\n\nChroma STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) is a feature representation used to capture the pitch content of an audio signal. This process involves mapping the audio onto a 12-dimensional chroma space, which corresponds to the 12 pitch classes commonly found in Western music.\n\nThe computation of Chroma STFT begins with the application of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to the audio signal. STFT analyzes the spectral content over time by breaking the signal into short segments and computing the Fourier Transform separately on each segment. This provides a time-varying spectral representation.\n\nFollowing the STFT, the spectral information is aggregated into chroma features. These chroma features summarize the entire spectrum by focusing on the 12 different pitch classes, effectively reducing the complexity of the data while retaining essential information about the pitch content. This makes Chroma STFT particularly useful for tasks that involve recognizing musical notes or chords, regardless of the specific octaves in which they occur.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chroma_stft = librosa.feature.chroma_stft(y=audio, sr=sr)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))\nlibrosa.display.specshow(chroma_stft, x_axis='time', y_axis='chroma', sr=sr)\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.xlabel('Time (s)')\nplt.ylabel('Pitch Class')\nplt.title('Chroma STFT')\nplt.show()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"height: 8px; background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, red); border-radius: 4px;\"></div>\n\n## RMS Mean\n\nRMS Mean, or Root Mean Square Mean, is a key audio feature that represents the average energy or amplitude of an audio signal over time. It serves as a summary measure of the overall loudness or intensity of the audio.\n\nThe computation of RMS Mean involves several steps:\n1. **Calculating the RMS for each time frame**: The RMS value for a given time frame is calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the sample amplitudes within that frame. This method ensures that all amplitude values are non-negative, providing a true measure of the signal's power.\n2. **Averaging RMS values**: Once the RMS values are calculated for each time frame, the RMS Mean is obtained by averaging these values. This average provides a consistent measure of the audio signal's loudness across its entire duration.\n\nBy quantifying the signal's loudness, the RMS Mean is particularly useful in applications where audio levels need to be normalized or compared across different recordings.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rms = librosa.feature.rms(y=audio)\nrms_mean = rms.mean()\n\nprint(\"RMS Mean:\", rms_mean)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"height: 8px; background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, red); border-radius: 4px;\"></div>\n\n## Spectral Centroid Mean\n\nThe Spectral Centroid Mean is a crucial audio feature that represents the average \"center of mass\" of the spectrum of an audio signal over time. It effectively measures the weighted mean of the frequencies present in the signal, where their magnitudes serve as the weights. This feature is computed as the mean of the spectral centroid values across different time frames.\n\n### Importance\nThe Spectral Centroid Mean provides a summary measure of the overall tonal character or spectral brightness of the audio signal.

This metric quantifies the mean spread or width of the frequencies in the signal's spectrum.\n\n### Importance \n\nSpectral Bandwidth provides crucial information about the spectral complexity or variation in frequency content of the audio signal. Essentially, it measures how much the energy of a signal is spread across different frequencies. A larger bandwidth indicates a broader spread of frequencies, suggesting a more complex sound, while a narrower bandwidth suggests a purer tone with fewer frequency components.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"spectral_bandwidths = librosa.feature.spectral_bandwidth(y=audio, sr=sr)\nspectral_bandwidths_mean = spectral_bandwidths.mean()\n\nprint(\"Spectral Bandwidth Mean:\", spectral_bandwidths_mean)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"height: 8px; background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, red); border-radius: 4px;\"></div>\n\n# Spectral Rolloff Mean\n\nSpectral Rolloff Mean is a significant audio feature that represents the average frequency below which a specified percentage of the total spectral energy of an audio signal is concentrated.

This measure provides a valuable insight into the temporal variations or the frequency of rapid changes in the audio signal.\n\n## Understanding Zero-Crossing Rate\n\nZero-crossing rate is a critical parameter in digital signal processing that quantifies how frequently the amplitude of the audio waveform crosses the zero value. This rate is particularly indicative of the noise level and timbral characteristics of the signal.

This metric provides a summary measure of the overall harmonic content and musical tonality, offering insights into the structural and aesthetic qualities of music and sound.\n\n## Significance of Harmony in Audio Analysis\n\nHarmony, in the context of music and audio, refers to the simultaneous combination of tones, especially when blended into chords that are pleasing to the ear. Consonance, or the degree of harmony, is crucial for understanding the musicality and mood conveyed by an audio signal. A higher harmony mean suggests a richer and more consonant harmonic structure, which is typical in melodious and harmonically complex music.

Feature scaling helps improve the convergence of steepest descent algorithms, which are commonly used in machine learning optimizations.\n\n### Using `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn\n\n`StandardScaler` is a preprocessing utility in Scikit-learn that standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This process, often called Z-score normalization, transforms the features such that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n\nHere's how to apply `StandardScaler` to our training and testing datasets:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"scaler = StandardScaler()\nX_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = scaler.transform(X_test)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n<div style=\"height: 8px; background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, red); border-radius: 4px;\"></div>\n\n## Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) is a robust and versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is particularly well-suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets. SVM works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes with the maximum margin. \n\nEffective tuning of SVM hyperparameters is essential to maximize the model's performance. These hyperparameters include the kernel type, the penalty parameter C, and gamma. `GridSearchCV` facilitates this by exhaustively searching through a specified grid of hyperparameter values and determining the combination that yields the best performance through cross-validation. This systematic approach not only enhances the model's accuracy but also its generalizability to new data. I have applied `GridSearchCV` to other machine learning methods as well to ensure optimal performance across different algorithms.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the parameter distribution for SVM\nparam_dist_svm = {\n    'C': loguniform(1e-4, 1e+1),  # Narrower range for C\n    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'],  # Only linear and RBF kernels\n    # 'gamma': loguniform(1e-4, 1e-3)  # Consider removing if using a linear kernel\n}\n\n# Create the SVM classifier and randomized search object\nsvm = SVC(random_state=42)\nrandom_search_svm = RandomizedSearchCV(\n    svm, param_distributions=param_dist_svm, n_iter=50,  # Reduced number of iterations\n    scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1, random_state=42  # Use all available cores\n)\n\n# Fit the randomized search to the data\nrandom_search_svm.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Evaluate the SVM model with the best parameters on the test set\nbest_svm = random_search_svm.best_estimator_\ny_pred_svm = best_svm.predict(X_test)\ntest_accuracy_svm = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_svm)\n\n# Evaluate the SVM model on the training set\ny_train_pred_svm = best_svm.predict(X_train)\ntrain_accuracy_svm = accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred_svm)\n\nprint(\"Train SVM Accuracy:\", train_accuracy_svm)\nprint(\"Test SVM Accuracy:\", test_accuracy_svm)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"height: 8px; background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, red); border-radius: 4px;\"></div>\n\n## Decision Tree (DT)\n\nDecision Tree (DT) is a popular and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by breaking down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets based on different criteria, effectively building a tree-like model of decisions. Each node in the decision tree represents a feature in the dataset that leads to a decision, and each leaf node represents a class label or a regression outcome. Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize, making them an excellent choice for initial data exploration and analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the parameter distribution for Decision Tree\nparam_dist_dt = {\n    'max_depth': randint(1, 51),  # Integer range [1, 50]\n    'min_samples_split': randint(2, 11),  # Integer range [2, 10]\n    'min_samples_leaf': randint(1, 11),  # Integer range [1, 10]\n    'criterion': ['gini', 'entropy'],  # Categorical\n    # Consider adding 'max_leaf_nodes': randint(2, 50) for additional pruning\n}\n\n# Create the Decision Tree classifier and randomized search object\ndt = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)\nrandom_search_dt = RandomizedSearchCV(\n    dt, param_distributions=param_dist_dt, n_iter=50,  # Reduced number of iterations\n    scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1, random_state=42  # Use all available cores\n)\n\n# Fit the randomized search to the data\nrandom_search_dt.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Evaluate the Decision Tree model with the best parameters on the test set\nbest_dt = random_search_dt.best_estimator_\ny_pred_dt = best_dt.predict(X_test)\ntest_accuracy_dt = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_dt)\n\n# Evaluate the Decision Tree model on the training set\ny_train_pred_dt = best_dt.predict(X_train)\ntrain_accuracy_dt = accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred_dt)\n\nprint(\"Train DT Accuracy:\", train_accuracy_dt)\nprint(\"Test DT Accuracy:\", test_accuracy_dt)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"height: 8px; background: linear-gradient(to right, orange, red); border-radius: 4px;\"></div>\n\n## Random Forest (RF)\n\nRandom Forest (RF) is an ensemble learning technique that builds upon the simplicity of decision trees by combining multiple such trees to form a more powerful model. By aggregating the decisions of a multitude of decision trees, each trained on different subsets of the same data, Random Forests reduce the risk of overfitting and typically provide much higher accuracy than individual decision trees.

It classifies a new data point based on the majority vote of its 'k' nearest neighbors, with 'k' being a user-defined constant. KNN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification.
